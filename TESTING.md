# Testing Guide

This project now includes a comprehensive Vitest test suite to ensure the @it-throws functionality works correctly.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the WASM module (required before testing)
wasm-pack build crates/what-does-it-throw-wasm --target nodejs --out-dir ../../server/src/rust

# Run the test suite
bun run test
```

## What We've Achieved ✅

The comprehensive @it-throws suppression is now **fully implemented and tested**:

### Before (Issue)
```typescript
// @it-throws
function processUser() {
  const result = saveToDatabase(user); // ❌ Still showed "Function call may throw"
  throw e; // ❌ Still showed "Throw statement"
}
// ❌ Still showed "Function processUser may throw"
```

### After (Fixed) 
```typescript
// @it-throws
function processUser() {
  const result = saveToDatabase(user); // ✅ Suppressed
  throw e; // ✅ Suppressed
}
// ✅ Function diagnostic suppressed
```

## Test Coverage

Our test suite covers:

1. **Comprehensive Suppression** ✅
   - Function declaration diagnostics suppressed
   - Call diagnostics within @it-throws functions suppressed  
   - Throw statement diagnostics suppressed
   - Call chain propagation working

2. **Assignment Call Detection** ✅
   - `// @it-throws\nconst result = functionCall();` works
   - Original user scenario fully resolved

3. **Edge Cases** ✅
   - Multiple @it-throws functions
   - Complex assignment patterns
   - Cross-function call chains

## Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run just the core functionality test
bun run test tests/comprehensive-suppression.test.ts

# Run in watch mode for development
bun run test:watch

# View test results in browser UI
bun run test:ui
```

## Implementation Details

The solution involved:

1. **Enhanced CallFinder** - Improved @it-throws detection for assignment calls
2. **Comprehensive Suppression** - Function-level suppression that cascades to all diagnostics
3. **Proper Call Chain Tracking** - Calls within @it-throws functions are suppressed

The system now provides exactly what was requested: `@it-throws` acts as a comprehensive suppression flag that silences ALL throw-related diagnostics for the entire function.
